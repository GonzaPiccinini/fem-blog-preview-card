## My process

First, I started thinking and building the HTML layout so that it would be easier later when I'm styling with CSS.<br>
Then, I used a [normalize.css](/normalize.css) to avoid errors that could appear at any time from one of the common browsers.<br>
And finally, I began styling the HTML layout creating the proper variables and implementing Mobile-first workflow, allowing me improve my design skills with this approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how variable and static fonts are differents and how it's works. In simple words, variable fonts are:
- An alternative that allows you to modify one (or more) axes of variation with one single file.
- A way to improve the website accessibility.

### Continued development

In my future projects I'll try to improve responsive web design by learning and practicing more CSS!

### Useful resources

- [Difference between static and variable fonts](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/variable-fonts-vs-static-fonts#:~:text=Static%20Fonts%20do%20not%20support,Fonts%20offer%20multiple%20typographic%20variations.) - This helped me understand the behavior of variable and static fonts.
